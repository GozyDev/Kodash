Kodash

Kodash is a multi-tenant, workspace-based productivity system built with Next.js and Supabase. Each workspace acts as its own isolated environment, making it ideal for client work, product management, or personal projects. You begin by creating issues, and only when you need structure do you group them into projects. The workflow stays clean, fast, and flexible.

What Makes Kodash Different

Traditional tools like Linear and Asana are built for internal teams. Kodash flips the model. Every workspace represents a client, a product, or a personal environment. You are never forced into project-first workflows. You capture issues immediately and structure them later when it matters.

Core Features

Multi-Tenant Architecture
Every workspace is fully isolated using Supabase Row-Level Security. Perfect for freelancers, agencies, or builders managing multiple clients or products.

Issue-First Workflow
Issues come first. They can be tasks, bugs, ideas, or notes. Add statuses, priorities, tags, and descriptions. Assign them to a project only when you want organization.

Projects as Optional Structure
Projects start empty. When you are ready, you can group specific issues under goals, releases, features, or milestones. Issues live independently and projects simply act as containers.

Workspace-Level Membership
Users are added to specific workspaces, not globally. Boundaries stay clean and controlled.

Dashboard Overview
A simple view of recent issues, statuses, and active projects inside each workspace. Light analytics planned.

Responsive Interface
Designed with TailwindCSS for a clean, modern, and accessible interface across all devices.

Current Status

Kodash is actively under development. Multi-tenant routing is being refined, workspace isolation is being strengthened with RLS, issue and project flows are being polished, and the UI is undergoing continuous iteration.

Vision

Kodash aims to be the simplest workspace-first productivity system for managing client projects, personal tools, multi-product pipelines, or small teams. No forced structure. No clutter. Just a flexible issue-first environment you can shape around your work.
